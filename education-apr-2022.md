# education (apr 2022)

Sentementalisms Education is the gift of hard earned insight and experience handed down through generations. More than the simple the transmission of accumulated knowledge, education is an iterative process that refines knowledge \[through experience] into wisdom and practical knowhow. As it passes from one generation to the next.

We are the proud inheritors of this cumulative endeavor of generations, the pursuit of ever better ways to do things, ever clearer understanding of the world around us. Wealth

Positive-sum game

In our vision \[in the age of EVR] With barriers lowered, we see the reach of both formal and non formal education expanded to include \[embrace, incorporate, enfranchise] any and all who would choose to participate. We see the arts, sciences, humanities, and trades flourish under this new open access model. We see previously intractable conflicts brought to heel, impossible problems solved. Lateral and vertical mobility. Because previously unheard perspectives were given voice.
