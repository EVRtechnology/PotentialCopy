# Klau marketing pitch (oct 2019)

Your potential is incredible. I believe in your potential, we humans have tamed fire, created music, developed games, grown food, even the simple yet so complex act of cooking. You, we, hold the potential to create and destroy whole worlds. How are you going to use that potential? How are you using that potential? How have you used this potential so far?

Imagine a world where you are on a path to find your own golden treasure, your 'IKIGAI’.

'IKIGAI’ is a Japanese 'way of living', it is “your reason to wake up in the morning”. 'ikigai’ is the center of what you love, what you are good at, what you can get paid for, and what the world needs.

This question fostered a burning question; what am I here for? A question that burns in all of our minds at some point in our early awakening. Since asking that question of myself, I’ve met many people who walk blindly into a non personal, outdated, in some cases more than a century old story told to us by current systems.

Stories like; “Go to school, get good grades, memorize what you are taught. Forget about finding what you are passionate about. Apply to colleges or get scholarships. If not, get loans, go into debt but, no worries since a college degree is sure to get you a good job, with living wages. True happiness is just around the corner.

Are you familiar with this fairytale?

When people follow this tale, instead of encountering their passion they encounter emptiness, instead of encountering a job they enjoy, they encounter debt and disappointment, and instead of finding happiness, they become depressed.

In today’s world, depression, anxiety, and a sense of loneliness are at a peak. Especially among the newer generations, who are told that the amount of likes and comments on your pictures define how many ‘friends’ you have. They compare themselves to the highly curated online content, even though it is mostly fake.

It is not social media's fault. We are in the infancy of Social Media. We are not using the full capacity of our technology.

Our project is about making Human Being easier.

Story Brand

The Hero wants to be able to track all their abilities, skills and interactions in order to fulfill their potential. On their path to their ikigai, they shall encounter mentors, peers, and mentees who will walk alongside them.

Villain:

External: The systems in place who constantly oppress individuals and prevents them from following their passion. Especially the outdated tale we still tell our youth. Some even still believe it!

Internal: Their human need for meaning and community is not being fulfilled.

Philosophical: It's time for an evolution of consciousness. Depression and anxiety are skyrocketing, no progress will be made if no action is taken now.

Guide:

Empathy: We are all human, we know you are here to do more than eat, sleep and poop. We also know how alone each one of us is.

Authority: It is our responsibility to remember, teach, and learn our skills with those around us, to keep humanity moving forward. To be community focused (helping and teaching each other) as well as acknowledging and respecting each others sovereignty.

Plan

Process: Listen to our talks or go on the current social media. Each other!

Agreement (to make them feel safe and good to go through with the plan)

You can try our app, there's a month free trial for you to get started. There's Ikigai app members who will help you learn how to use the app to its fullest extent. When you meet someone from the app there is ikigai verified spaces as well as interaction reviews to keep you safe. Won’t hurt ya to try!

Call to action

Direct: Install our app! And to remember is more than just another social media, it's supposed to take you from the phone to the world in a fun way.

Transitional: Different version of app and bug fixes as well as experimental versions.

Character Transformation:

From 'ordinary' inexperienced, probably depressed, and non verifiable human.

To a human in control of their data and life with a sense of belonging and purpose.

That ends in success

Will get real life verified experience for their skills and abilities. Will be able to easily find projects, opportunities, and jobs that WANT them. Will find a community (guild) where they fit in and even find a 'party' to join if they want to. Will be able to help others to better their own skills. Feel as if their life is a fantasy world with adventures and possibilities.

That helps them avoid failure

No real experience from the field they want to get involved in. Won't be verified in their skills. Won't find mentors, peers or mentees. Won't find fulfilling projects. Won't find where they belong. Won't stay up to date. Won't adapt to the current world (and become obsolete if it’s a company, such as a school, who doesn’t adapt.)
