# marketing pitch (oct 2019)

We’re making an app

A new way for people to connect with one another, and it has the power to change the world.

I mean, you can see the problems that we’re facing; Our societies are polarized, -and we can't seem to find common ground. Our institutions are failing us, -but we don’t know how to get by without them. Most people aren't happy in their jobs, -feeling undervalued and bored. We live in a disconnected age, stifled and unfulfilled.

But it doesn't have to be that way. We have the means, technologically and otherwise, to get around all of that; but most importantly we have the drive. People, this species, this human species wants to work together.

It's in our nature as a species. We don’t have fangs, claws, fur or horns. We weren’t the biggest, strongest, or baddest on the savannah. But we were clever. And we had the ability share our imaginations and network with one another. To plan, come together, and execute these ideas we came up with. That’s why, we’re at the top of the food chain. That’s why this species is the dominant force on the planet.

But here’s the thing: we don't know how to do that anymore, not in this environment. We’ve got all the access to information and to resources we could ever want, -more than any other time in history; but we’re missing part of the equation: the human part. We don't know how to connect to one another anymore. -Not in any meaningful way. People want to feel connected to one another, but it's hard.

We are here to fix that.

\-We used to say that it took a village to raise a child, but where they're turning is social media; because that's the closest thing they can find to community. And its failing them miserably: rates of anxiety, depression, and self harm are ALL up in this age of smart phones and social media.
