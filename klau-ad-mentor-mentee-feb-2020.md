# Klau ad Mentor mentee (feb 2020)

The mentor and mentee - Story

You are a young woman, and you are trying to learn a new skill since you are finally starting your life! You are trying to learn how to sew so you try starting by looking up YouTube videos, but when you try, the fabric bunches, you aren’t sure how to follow the video correctly. You then try going to a bookstore, there’s a book that looks promising but It’s not working for you, this time your seam is too loose, then its sideways, but you try to make do. After some trial and error you’re able to get a little bag made, it’s good as long as you don’t see the seams. Either way you try showing it to your friends and the only response you get is a ‘cool’, no deep connection, you wonder how it is possible to be surrounded by people and yet feel so alone. So you share your project on a Facebook sewing group, you get a couple likes, maybe a “:)” comment, and you continue to feel alone, like an astronaut up in space. You don’t feel like picking up the sewing machine, so instead you start playing a video game, after all, success is easy when you know what success is, when you have a map that tells you where to go, who to meet, the tools you need. You close your computer and start scrolling through Instagram, comparing yourself to beautiful women, when something different catches your eye. A new app called IRL.

Now imagine you are on the other side of this, you are an eldery woman, you savor each of your days since you don’t know how many you have left. But it is hard to savor them when your family doesn’t visit you much, but it’s okay, they are busy. You wander through the house you’ve been in for the past 50 years, and when you walk through your old sewing machine your eyes fill with warm light as you remember being a little girl, how your mother would sit you on her lap and teach you how to sew, how to grab the fabric just right. As you got older your mother and you kept sewing together, making the clothes for your children, helping mend your friend’s clothes, and even making yourself something nice once in a while. You close your eyes, wanting to keep that feeling forever, but when you open them once more you are back to your home, to a dusty sewing machine, and to the feeling of uselessness you have oh so often.

You keep walking and sit on your couch, turn on the news, and act as if you are paying attention even if your thoughts are elsewhere. Wishing that you could pass on the knowledge your family has had for decades, but you don’t want to force it onto your children since that wouldn’t be fair.

While you are watching the news, you see an ad for an app. You realize that even if you are old, you still use facebook and this new thing doesn’t seem harder to use than what you are used to.

This app is called IRL.

You both try it, you both join the local sewing guild, and you decide to meet through there. You have now made an informed decision to go through with the interaction, and when you meet your eyes can shine once more. You finally have a mentor to guide you, you finally have a mentee to pass on your knowledge to, you are no longer alone.

A few months go by, after multiple interactions, trials, you sit in a small runway. When your design comes out, the crowd goes wild. It is a combination of classic style with modern flow, this dress represents more than just a dress, it represents friendship, the type of friendship you don’t get anywhere else, a deep seeded friendship.
