# Environmental appeal Mar 2022)

Issue in brief

Awareness isn’t enough, and consumerism won’t save us.

Context explained

Most people know two things: That our ecosystem is dying, and that there’s nothing they can do about it.

The most popular \[immaging, propoganda, zeitgeist, theory, image, solution, alternative] is ethical consumerism: vote with your wallet.

Buying certified products is a good start, for those who can afford it, but its not a solution.

Petroleum companies are rebranding themselves as eco-friendly. No one believes it.

Industry would have us believe that Ethical consumerism is a viable alternative\
Protection which needs government intervention, Or restoration which involves an organization they’re not a part of.

Those who can afford to donate money already do, to finance projects already do, to shop ethically already do and can continue to do so.. But as income inequality and discretionary income lowers, there an untapped resource to make chane happen.

Compare the number of people who KNOW theres a problem to the number of people actively doing something about it, and the difference is stark.

Most lay around feeling bad, bc they cant vote with their wallets.

For most people, the alternative to global environmental collapse is ethical consumerism.

Its not antipathy

Ethical- environmental- or conscientious- consumerism.

Everything will be fine so long as you can afford to go green.

Austerity measures, -avoid thing A, dont guy thing B, again

A campaign to find more dollars is going to have limited success.

Immediate solution

Direct action The problem is that the greatest offering these would-be allies have to offer isnt in their paltry bank accounts, it’s in their heads, their hearts, their hands.

Continually finding better ways to do things, even if that doesnt involve buying something new

Direct abto

Finding support networks, make organizing easier, sharing of resources easier,

Giving their money to a good cause, they want to give a part of themselves to that cause. Not only will they, but they want to -loo at rates of depression, what happens when you cant do something about a thing, disempowerment.

Indirect solution

If more people were doing what they love, we woulnt see a rise in vampant consumerism, we’d see engaging with what makes them feel good. Tools, tips, and tricks Imagine increasing the effectivenes of tool and ride sharing, of community gardens and CSA’s, campaigning for change, boycotts, city clean-ups, restorations, the sharing of knowledge about ecosystems and their maintenance.

The signing of petitions itself could be much easier, or could could easily turn into a boycott, or a march.

This is going to run counter to what most assume because it doesnt subscribe to the industry line.

Direct, indirect, and emergent consequences. Roof top garden, closet cricket farm, invasive species hike, guerilla gardening, CSA, Building local industry that supports local people practices,

Emergent solution

Most of the dammage is caused by extractive and exploitive industry. Its not that all
