The fourth panel is GAMIFICATION

Disaster relief application It’s a well-known fact that communities fare better than individuals in times of need, it’s also a well-known fact or should be a well-known fact that in times of crisis people do come together to help one another. It’s built into the genetics to the genetic fabric of our species. In times of crisis people will come together to help one another, but often they can only do so in limited ways. With ever we can identify people beforehand or are going to fulfill specific functions in times of need. We can know who to turn to two clear the roadways, to stop the flooding, to take care of the little old lady in apartment 28 who doesn’t have air-conditioning when the power goes out. People and communities people who know one another 10 to take care of one another they know to ask the questions they know to look out for each other. Not to mention that you could pretty easily put together a guild or two that was dedicated exclusively to disaster relief, to be able to coordinate loggers to cut fire breaks during forest fire season to be able to coordinate heavy equipment operators who can move things out of the way when times get difficult to be able to train first responders non-professional first responders volunteer first responders for when things go awry. Ever can function as an automated Amanda control station to get information out to the people that need it and to get information in to the people in this world. Ever comes with its own disaster relief protocol that needs to get develop properly with first responder agencies so that your average person with her skill sets will be able to help in times of need.

Environmental application Most people know that there’s a problem and most people want to do something about it but most people don’t have realistic things they can do. Beyond going green beyond ego capitalism beyond just voting with your dollars there’s a whole workforce of people out there ready and willing and waiting to do something to affect the type of change that we all know we need. This platform can make those opportunities and those needs visible to a huge untapped resource, if we’re talking about the basics of recycling programs of farm tables of cleanups of any sort of thing that requires manpower. Rather than being stuck in a consumer cycle of trying to buy the best thing or the most you can take actual positive effects of action. The potential for organizing around a movement Around the cause is so much easier whatever. Not to mention the sort of untapped intellectual and scientific potential that right now are going to waste. We need more people working on more solutions more able to work on more solutions and to be able to find one another to net work and coordinate.

Business application Knowing who to go into business with, the people you go into business with is largely going to determine your success. The success of any business is going to depend largely on three things one the people he going to business with to the people you do business with three being able to train your people properly. First establish businesses, training is one of the biggest concerns. I know we could hire knowing how to train them properly knowing that they’re doing the job in the way that they’re supposed to be doing the job. It’s quite a task. Whatever you can standard operations you can standardize your training at any level of business endeavor you can know that your people are doing things according to best practices according to the methods laid out and you can get important feedback at all levels of organization of how different training SOP‘s are working. You can effectively manage large groups of people make informed decisions based on the way everybody you can know we are hiring before you hire them properly after you do continues into the future. For making a business it’s business with to know their reputation to know their past experience to know what they’re capable of what they’ve proven in the past. This is the way that you for businesses that are established this is the way that you get better business practices and ensure that your training is right and proper and up-to-date. I know you prevent bad mistakes or misunderstandings from compiling in a way that’s doesn’t require oversight or oversight is built into and quality assurance is built into the system. For up-and-coming businesses it’s a way to gather your people around you to source the employees and the partners that you’re going to be working with. It’s also a good way to figure out sourcing And outsourcing for materials and services.

Philanthropic application There’s no shortage of people that want to do good things, and there’s no shortage of people who have worthwhile projects. What there is is a gap between those two worlds, between those people. There are plenty or willing to donate their money or their time and service of something greater than themselves but as it stands they don’t have a way to do that, they don’t have a way to know that their efforts whether financial or labor will be rewarded. Will be worthwhile. There’s a real issue with who to trust, because trust is not easily come by it’s some thing that Has to be earned and for those without the good fortune of experiencing and building those trusting relationships firsthand it can be really difficult to get into that space. Was ever a persons reputation, their past opportunities their past accomplishments are visible to people who would want to work with them, to people who might want to find their future projects, and the people who are looking for real ways to make real impact. Some of us have an excess of time, an excess of money, or an excess of good ideas. And rather letting those valuable resources language unused, this is a way for them to come into fruition. For those very important connections to be made, and four things that benefit us all to flourish.

Social application A lot of said about upward mobility in society and it’s true that Alvaro will facilitate that upward mobility to make it easier to rise above your current level of understanding of comprehension of proficiency and attain new heights. But our focus for social application isn’t so much upward mobility as it is lateral mobility and lateral interconnectedness. Agreed many other issues have to do with the unreliability of the other, ever provides a window opportunities in ever provided a window to engage with other people and recognize their humanity. To bring people together over their shared interests and passions instead of pulling them apart over their disagreements. It’s about crossing using interests and passions to cross cultural and economic divides. Using those bridges to Asha ran some sort of sharing and caring. To get people connected with one another in a way that is impossible to do through anything but a shared suffering a shared pursuit and a shared interest. One of the biggest problems is that people don’t recognize or take responsibility for the things that they could. They don’t help people that they don’t know, and that’s just a natural way that things are. But if we can get people to know one another, that’s the first step to caring that’s the first step to giving a shit about somebody else. This is an engine for empathy the act of engaging with people drives empathy drives compassion and becomes a window end of the humanity of another person. It makes opportunities visible to literally anyone that is willing to take that next step anyone that is willing to meet with another person to engage in something that they care about. We’re talking about curing a compassion crisis but also a loneliness crisis also an existential crisis where in too many people don’t have some thing that gives the meaning in life think it was a connection to other people or the lesson to be a part of something. Software makes people a part of something gives them that connection and those connections provide a Safetynet better than any sort of government program can.

Educational application For industrial for conventional established institute of higher education ever offers a way to incorporate real world experience and real world education into the conventional education of that student body. We offer a way for students away from home to feel more connected to their peers to incorporate and their surroundings easier. And if I find a more rich and fulfilling on campus life. For institutions the added benefit can be seen through the height invisibility of what their degree programs offer, for students to be able to find the tutors that they need and their fellow students to help them achieve their academic goals. Vocationally it offers a quick easy reference point of reference for their accomplishments their standings and their contributions and their experience within that field of study. Beyond or outside of in addition to conventional education as a supplement to conventional education independent of conventional education ever offers the normalization of standards and practices and techniques to get people to know what they’re doing, it’s in formal education at its finest because get out only good parts of formal education which are standardization and oversight, it incorporates in formal learning and impromptu learning which is what most adults do.
