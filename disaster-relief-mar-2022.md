# Disaster relief (Mar 2022)

Issue in brief

Government responses are slow and ineffective.

Context explained

Things arenet going to get better any fucking tieme soon. Its going to get much worse. We dont have the capacty to handle it rn, and youre on some bullshit if you think gov or ngos are gonna respond right to a situation. Ineddefive, ineffectual assholes interested mostly in optics rather than doing anything to help the actual fucking people on the ground. Yes, plz, show up after a flood and put a bullet in someones back. Ourside agencies dont know how to map the resources or the needs lf people, know who does -the fucking people.

Immediate effect

First off, places where people know one another have a better survivability index than places that dont. Mitigate the worst of the damage simply by being aware that other people exist in your world.

Intermediate solution

You help those who you know, Who needs food, who needs a way to cook it, who needs shelter, who needs transportation,

Emergent solution

Build out that connects resource providers with those in need.

Emergency Management Protocal

What the fuck can your guild do in the event of an emergency, what do you know how to do. What are your anticipated needs.

Emergency preparedness plans and training. Identify needs of community BEFORE disaster happens. Dont be caught flatfooted

Talk with existing “authorities”

Can you move rubble after an earctquake, can you stop flooding, can you dead lines

Can you clear trees, do you have the heavy equipment to clear obstructions Can you render first aid, can you comfort the elderly and very young

Can you cook food, can you host refugees, do you have a boat (that one story about doaters rescuing survivors

Can you watch an animal, can you transport people to get their meds Can you do laundry, Can you clean an area

Identify shortcomings, vunerabiliies Can you provide an air conditioned space, a heated space, can someone get a fucking shower at your place, a way to charge phones, clean water, can you cut a fire break,

Dont just sit by or out of the way waiting for help that will never come, help our damn selves

Designated that this is the way i will help, Forwards need directly to guild org, I can contribut this much of this resource. Resolve need On to the next one. What if communications go down?

Information gathering system: this road is flooded, this road is on fire, live uptodate maps or obstructions, problem areas, considerations.

Uuber servies style -this is where your help is, when they’re coming Understanding that NOTHING is charged for services A state of emergency is in effect, fuck any consideration that prevents positive action from eing taken. State of emergency posts and protocols for whomever wants to help. Allow them to bring their best seves forward.

Need to make one thing very clear: your community will show p for you.

Coordinate response efforts Learn from one anothers emergency situations Share what works, what doesnt, Only time that things are tracked?

There are not two classes of people responders and victime. There are two status, needs assistance, provides services.

Fist aid certification, first award, first training standards management buildout, Not merely victims,

Are you contributing a physical resource, an action, or information.
